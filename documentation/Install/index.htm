<P  id="Description" class="Header1">Description</P>
<P>Ladder is a data management system that uses a heirarchical structure to manage 
 the relationships of information. Ladder works with many existing storage 
 mediums .. from Microsoft Access to Microsoft SQL. The relationships are 
 stored in one table as a tree, while the instance data of each class is 
 stored in several other tables.</P>
<P>The tree is used to store the relationships of the 
information. As information is gathered and stored, it's relationship to 
other informaiton can be managed by storing the relationships in a 
folder. Instances of data can be shared amongst folders simply by 
creating a link in the corresponding folders to the instance data.</P>
<P>The instance data is stored in seperate tables. 
The table name is located by reviewing the class information for the 
instance. For example, if the informaiton stored in the instance pertained 
to telephoen numbers, then your objects that manage telephone numbers might use 
a table named "Telephone". They however don't have to, and thus you're 
free to choose a table name, so long as it doesn't exist with other existing 
tables.</P>

<P>Ladder needs to know how to connect to your SQL server.  This information is stored in: <BR>
<blockquote>LadderSrvr \ shared \ _app.php </blockquote>
</P>
<P>
To confirm that Ladder Server is connecting to your SQL server, browse to the following page:
<blockquote>http://192.168.0.250/LadderSrvr/connected.php </blockquote>
</P>
<P>
Ladder Server is ready to recieve POST JSON commands through CURL calls at :
<blockquote>http://192.168.0.250/LadderSrvr/tree.php </blockquote>
</P>
<P>
The JSON commands are: 	
<blockquote>
	Ladder:isInstalled - are the Ladder's tables installed in the SQL server?<BR>
	Ladder:Install - create Ladder's tables in the SQL server<BR>
	Ladder:unInstall - remove Ladder's tables from the SQL server<BR>
</blockquote>	
For additional information on the POST JSON calls, look at the Ladder Client Interface Libraries. 
Published seperately.

<P>This version of Ladder is a prototype whose sole purpose is to demonstrate the concept, 
functionality and possible uses.  Future versions of Ladder Server may not rely on a Web Server,
3rd party language, or a SQL Database Server.  Development is underway to make Ladder Server 
a full fledge stand-alone product.
